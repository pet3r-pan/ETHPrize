<p class="c8"></p>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-0 start" start="1">
<li class="c2"><span class="c7 c1">Who are you and what are you
working on?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I studied Computer Engineering
and am a full stack dev. I started my career by programming web
stuff and distributed systems.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">A year ago I had heard a lot
about BTC and “blockchain”, so I got involved.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">My life goal is to build the
technologies that will make people’s lives easier and more
free.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Cryptocurrencies clearly can do
this, but Ethereum specifically - because of the community, and the
fully functional VM on a chain - is clearly the best platform we
have so far.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I knew Manuel from before, and
so got together with him and decided to start building some
tutorials and interaction guides to walk people through the same
forests I was exploring. Started contributing to Zeppelin as a
security researcher, because that is the major focus at the
company.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">This gave a lot of background as
I really had to grasp how thing happen in the EVM. You have to be
incredibly conscious and attentive about the stuff you’re
programming.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Auditing well-known projects
also really helped me grow my knowledge of how the whole ecosystems
works and what the best practices are.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">I am now building Zeppelin OS -
upgradable smart contracts, with a scheduler, and on chain standard
libraries.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">It’s a huge challenge to build
this on Ethereum currently, so I became a core member and we are
releasing our first version today!!</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-0" start="2">
<li class="c2"><span class="c7 c1">What are the
tools/libraries/frameworks you use?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;Truffle - I don’t really
like it, but have to use it.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">We can improve a lot of things
here and build some more things on top of it.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">Testing your contracts easily
across any network and setting your own defaults through the
console is not as easy as it should be.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">Truffle scripts allow you to
deploy your application, but the truffle environment itself is very
difficult to manage, especially if you need to modify it to fit
your specific project. You can lose days trying to do
that.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">We should start thinking about
providing an interface that can be consumed, extended and used by
other cmd line tools, and things like zeppelin_OS.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">The testing environment is
really good, but could still provide some extra features (like
better debugging and changing variable easily between tests without
needing to recompile everything).</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">I haven’t yet found one chance
to run the debugger properly - but we really need that and it
really needs to be easy to use.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-3 start" start="1">
<li class="c6"><span class="c0 c1">When I try to debug my contracts
on the network, I start logging events on the smart contract to see
what is happening. This is really slow, it is a waste of gas and is
not the way I want to handle things in the future.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2" start="7">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">We also use open zeppelin a lot
in our own projects: i.e. DApps we build ourselves, and zeppelin_OS
- an on chain version that can be used as a standard library for
zeppelin OS.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-3 start" start="1">
<li class="c6"><span class="c0 c1">Currently you have to deploy
manually the smart contracts from our libraries that you want to
use. But now, with zeppelin_OS, everyone can build a standard
library that can be linked to a project that is using zeppelin_OS
and everyone can use the same source code.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c0 c1">Say goodbye to all those
deploy-time issues ;)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2" start="8">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">We use many small helper
libraries: e.g. to do tricky things like testing low level calls,
crafted transactions where you need to specify very small things to
do with the data as an array of byte or whatever. Truffle provides
no friendly way to do this, so you have to start playing with
buffers of bytes and hashes and all sorts of nonsense.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-3 start" start="1">
<li class="c6"><span class="c0 c1">Ethereumjs-abi, ethereumjs-utils
etc.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2" start="9">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">Web3 is a great library. It’s
very simple, though it’s been a long time that they have been
promising a stable 1.0 version.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">MetaMask is also really useful -
makes life easier in so many ways.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">We use both geth and parity as
we have our own nodes to test things.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c1">Remix is really cool and it
works really well. I encourage people to use it and look forward to
new releases from them.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-3 start" start="1">
<li class="c6"><span class="c0 c1">Sharing sets/suites of contracts
easily can be improved.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-0" start="3">
<li class="c2"><span class="c7 c1">How do you handle
testing?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">We use Travis CI.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Coverall for coverage tests,
also for solidity coverage using solcoverage as a plugin. Super
useful to us.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Write plain mocha tests
(integration and unit) and we aim for 100% coverage
always.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">When working on DApps we usually
have standard paths to test how the UI works.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0 c16">This is another developer tool
that is missing: a tool to test UIs when signing
transactions.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-0" start="4">
<li class="c2"><span class="c12">What are your biggest
frustrations?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Speed of testing in Truffle is
taking ~15min and it should be 1-2 at most. We need to speed that
cycle up badly.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Ropsten is really slow when we need
to test something in a “real” network. We have needed to cancel
manually our own transactions and follow many rabbits down many
different holes to figure out what happened. We need a better, more
realistic testnet, for all our contracts.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">You can’t set breakpoints when
debugging contracts, or end-to-end transactions on the network and
this can cause you to lose the whole day when you miss something as
simple as a flag or a param in a contract etc.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">No easy way to log things in
Solidity, which makes missing the stuff above much easier than it
should be.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">The linter tools also take too
long. It should just be possible to install and run these sorts of
things without needing to do any config of your own, which is not
currently the case.</span></li>

<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">

hard to convince people to join and use the currency because of
this.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Legal issues around launching
companies and products are a real PITA. We need proper DAOs and
soon.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Came out of web dev industry, and
it is really mature. They have a lot of methodologies for running
projects and organising teams. Most people in Ethereum are very
young and these sort of processes are generally a mess.</span></li>

<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">There’s a lot of pressure on the
back of the price, and this or that ICO and we need to make sure
that the community supports and contributes to better, clearer,
slower processes that actually achieve the desired goals rather
than cutting corners to ship not-really-decentralized
products.</span></li>

<li class="c2"><span class="c7">Other domain specific
questions?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c3"><span class="c7">Upgradable smart
contracts?</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">We’ve been exploring many different
approaches over the last year, all of them using proxies: i.e a
contract using a delegateCall opcode to make things
happen.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Biggest problem: we had to store
information about 2 different domains, 1 of them being the proxy
information and the other the contract that needs to be
upgraded.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Proxy information: delegates each
call to implementation contract. Storage in proxy contract, logic
elsewhere, so not something new (Parity also uses this
pattern).</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">We don’t see how upgradability
works without some kind of mechanism for governance: the proxy
needs to ask someone/something if the contract can/should be
upgraded. This information needs to be stored as well: the “owner”
and the implementation details.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">The way solidity manages storage,
the contract that was going to be upgraded needed to follow the
storage slots where the proxy was saving the relevant information
because it is important not to overwrite them.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">We found a final approach that
manages this very elegantly: using inline assembly to store
variable and bypass the way solidity performs its own checks. We
are using storage slots that solidity will never be able to access,
which is how we can ensure our approaches are really safe and that
we can have upgradeable smart contracts that don’t overwrite
important information.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1" start="4">
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Why should we even have upgradeable
though, if immutability is such a big thing?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">We really don’t think
upgradeability works without governance.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">We have storage in one place and
logic in another. So the storage actually remains immutable and
will never forget what is put into it. We can modify it, but that
is part of the history and you can inspect those modifications
easily if you like.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">We are not leaving immutability
then, just handling it in a smarter way.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">The idea came from exploring the
strategy Solidity itself uses for mapping of variables, but with
some delta to make sure Solidity won’t overwrite
things.</span></li>

<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">For governance:</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">We are still exploring which models
are better for upgradeability. How to take into account the
community, dev team, investors etc. We need a governance pattern
that works specifically for upgradeability decisions, which tend to
be more focussed than larger governance questions and might lend
themselves to specific, narrow mechanisms.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c15">It may be possible to modify the
way the compiler maps state variable to storage, so that we can
allow people to implement similar patterns to ours without all the
inline assembly stuff.</span> <span class="c11">Might make a nice
bounty - improving the compiler in general to allow new features
specifically in terms of what you can do with the
EVM</span><span class="c0">.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c4 lst-kix_ucvx3wdaq3ex-1" start="2">
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Having a scheduler implies huge gas
costs, so we need to find scheduling mechanisms that will allow the
community to run transactions in a feature for you and be rewarded
with tokens or Eth or whatever. (see chronologic for this kind of
stuff too)</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c15">We are trying to see if there is
anyway to use TCRs and token curation markets in order to handle on
chain standard libraries and upgradeability too. The idea behind
zeppelin OS is to encourage other teams to build their own on chain
standard libraries and provide them through zeppelin OS to be used
in other projects.</span> <span class="c0 c16">We would love to see
the community come forward with suggestions about how this could be
best managed.</span></li>

resources I have!</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the things I love most about
Ethereum in general is the community, so we try to get to know as
many other projects as we can and collaborate with them. This is a
great way of finding quick answers to hard questions and getting an
overview of the best current tools available.</span></li>

<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Interested by Cardano: they have a
really different way of writing smart contracts on a

really good team, which is always a good lense for me to assess
projects through.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Neo is another interesting project.
Haven’t used it yet, but met them at a conference and they were
really focussed and clear about what they are going to be doing
over the next little while.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Cosmos is really interesting! It’s
really huge, but I am excited to see what happens
there.</span></li>

what path did they walk to get to where they are now.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">I would really like to know if we
are all doing the same things to get to where we are, or if there
are smarter ways to grow quickly without losing culture/vision.
Sometimes it feels like we’re all alone in the jungle, struggling
to survive, and it would be awesome if not everyone had to feel
this way going forward.</span></li>
<li class="c3"><span class="c0">Would also be helpful to see how
other companies are organising themselves on a day-to-day basis and
how they collaborate with other teams, with remote workers
