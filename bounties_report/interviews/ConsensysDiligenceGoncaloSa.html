<li class="c1"><span>I w</span><span class="c0">ork at Consensys
Diligence - focus on security of the ecosystem. Everything that is
related to security: it’s on our roadmap to tackle it.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">95% of our work today consists in
doing security audits on smart contracts - any EVM-compatible or
“compilable” code. That accounts for building security tools that
do the checks automatically, or that assist on manual
inspection.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">The goal is to eventually encompass
everything related to Ethereum security.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">I have always been hacking - a grey
hat of sorts.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Built an ad tech startup, which had
a built from scratch ad server that I did the architecture
for.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Had a mobile app to tell Portuguese
people what was happening in their city.</span></li>

</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">I used to use Remix a lot more than
I do today (though I still use it heavily).</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Use it as a text editor, in fact,
but mostly for debugger when I am auditing, especially when trying
to prove/disprove an attack I have thought up.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Visual debugging feature helps me a
lot. It’s not perfect, though.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1" start="2">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">We’re fans of dogfooding, so I use
Mythril a lot, which was initially created by Bernard, but is now
being developed by a bunch of people we hired.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Used mostly for automatic detection

<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Oyente is falling behind a bit, so
I haven’t used it in a long time.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Manticore is not built by us and
does the same thing as Mythril (we have compared it). Though the
inner workings are very different, the result is largely
similar.</span></li>

<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Have played with, but never tried
to integrate, Enchidna into my workflow, as it is difficult to work
with due largely to deadlines.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Rattle is closed source, so haven’t
yet got around to playing with it.</span></li>

<li class="c4"><span class="c6">What are your biggest
frustrations?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">I really, really want a good visual
debugger. I don’t think I’m alone on this one either, but I also
don’t think people are as passionate about this as I
am.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">My main motivation behind this is
that I really like visual debugging and it is just so much easier,
when debugging a very low level program, to have a visual
aide.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">It requires real experience to
reason about things at a very low level and see the effect of each
line of code.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Remix, right now, has a very steep
learning curve and we are missing the opportunity to make sure that
every developer coming in gets clear insight into the nitty gritty
details, the fine print, of the EVM that actually gives them full
control over what they are doing and what they want to
do.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">I feel that very contained
environments are usually more appealing to people just entering the
world of computers and programming.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">When Apple started with Swift
playgrounds and lots of integrations, I saw a bunch of people just
flocking into iOS development. It was just so easy to understand
what is happening - it’s all very visual and easy to
grok.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-0" start="4">
<li class="c4"><span class="c6">How do you handle
testing?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Remix, Surya and Mythril as
above.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Very small number of instances
where I need to do something off chain, for which I will then use
Truffle.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-0" start="5">
<li class="c4"><span class="c6">What tools don’t exist at the
moment?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">A proper, local dummy client. I
love the Truffle team and I love Ganache, which I use a
lot.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">I run a lot of tesst on Ganache,
which are not seamless to run on other machines, so I would love a
super seamless cross-platform client that has a great block
explorer in it.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Using the visual version of Ganache
about a month ago, I couldn’t see events being fired, or various
important details on transactions happening there. We need a more
full-fledged local client.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">We haven’t really prepared for how
to handle contracts across shards (coming months to years, who
knows?).</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">We are looking mostly at tools to
support the WASM architecture. This is likely the problem that will
take the most of our time, I think. I have talked to Johan Barbie
about this and I’m not sure anyone has a very good solution for
what a tool that would help scheme the interactions out actually
looks like.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">I am personally more worried about
language design stuff, and languages in general, than I am about
the consensus layer, or anything below the language and application
layer.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">We are also working hard on
updating our tools to support, for instance, Vyper. John has been
doing a terrific job there, doing contract translations from
Solidity to Vyper, built a plugin for Truffle.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Mythril will also eWASM at some
point before it goes into production.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-0" start="6">
<li class="c4"><span class="c6">What are the best educational
resources?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">I do this less frequently now, but
I basically watch every interesting repo to know what they are
doing next before any announcement or anything.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">I also spend a lot of time reading
the docs in that repo. In fact, a couple years back, I would spend
most of my time reading those kind of docs.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, the Ethereum wiki has a lot
of super involved stuff that is not easy to grasp and there should
be somewhere where those things are explained far more
simply.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, I’m a very visual guy, and
that wiki really lacks graphics and images that could be really
helpful in terms of giving a wider group of people insight into the
innards of the systems.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Things like RLP encoding,
Patricia-Merkle tries, or the ABI sender (which I went back to over
and over again until eventually getting to a sort of Eureka moment
re encoding reference types). I feel like the tries, in particular,
are very visual things.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">RLP graphic resources would really
help because it is such a specific thing.</span></li>
<li class="c1"><span>The Beige Paper is awesome, but it’s still not
the end game - it’s too technical still with almost no visual
guidance still requires a very big leap for people dealing with
blockchain for the first time.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-0" start="7">
<li class="c4"><span class="c6">Other bounties?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">None come to mind right now. Let’s
keep the focus on EthPM here - we need to make sure as many people
use it as possible! We should have done this a long time ago and we
need to dogfood it as a community!</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-0" start="8">
<li class="c4"><span class="c6">Who are the other people you think
we should talk to?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">Bernard Miller from our team,
focussed entirely on Mythril.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-0" start="9">
<li class="c4"><span class="c6">Other domain specific
questions?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-1 start" start="1">
<li class="c1"><span class="c0">What are the details/patterns in
smart contract audits you see often that people should not be
writing?</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c2 lst-kix_3ho2wwf5tpx9-2 start" start="1">
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">People are lacking the granular
insight that is required - along with the right
mindset/philosophy/paradigmatic approach to writing smart
contracts. This goes back to the need for better visual tools, in
my opinion.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">A lot of contracts do not
acknowledge that they are operating in a resource-constrained
environment. For instance, I see lots of loops - which is not a
desirable thing when operating on top of Ethereum.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">People also don’t have that
“asynchronous mindset”, unless you have been working with a very
strange stack indeed. Even people coming from JS and pure node
backgrounds - it’s not quite the same thing.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">They keep favouring push mechanism
when there should be a pull one (or vice versa).</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">In reality, this is a very hard
question. I do have a collection of very specific stuff I have seen
people do wrong, but - in a very general manner - the biggest
problem is bringing synchronous patterns into smart
contracts.</span></li>
<li class="c5"><span class="c0">Thinking of a way to have them do
otherwise, this whole thing is promoted by people not getting what
is actually happening beneath their code. They know it is
“distributed”, but what does that mean to them? Hence the need for
something like a Swift playground in order to make it easier to
grasp the use of resources on the network</span></li>
