1. Who are you and what are you working on?
   1. Working on Mist, the Ethereum browser.
      1. Developers contributing open-source.
      2. There’s a wall between core team & open-source team.
         1. Would love for people to be paid reliably for features.
      1. 3 Developers. Talk on Discord.
      2. Current experimentations in paying open-source developers:
         1. Colony
         2. Commit F
         3. We want beter Github integration. Now possible with Status Open Bounties and Gitcoin etc.
1. What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum?
      1. One dev working on a backend integration – I stopped working on this to work on one issue – “password wasn’t working for user” – couldn’t reproduce the bug. Could put a bounty for someone to recreate the bug & solve it.
      2. Different systems: Gitter, Github issues, different wallets 
      3. How we solved: created a single issue with all comments from other issues. Created google form for anyone who had an issue, to see if there’s a pattern amongst problems.
      4. What type of expertise is needed for this: we don’t have enough security oriented people on our team. We passed the bug reports to the Foundation security person, who tests them.[a]
         1. Single case: serious bug report came in and was fixed. But couldn’t test the fix, because they would have run exploit on their machines. They don’t have pen testers.
         2. Wanted – less of a wall between their team and the outside.
         3. Need:  Recurring open source developers --- that are working for bounties -- 
            1. They haven’t tried bounties yet.
            2. Is the problem: dev awareness or payment?
            3. They’re making app more modular.
1. How do you handle testing?
   1. People build new features, we check, and then approve it.
   2. We’ve had issues – 
   3. Meteor.js migrating to React.
1. Who are the other people you think we should talk to?
   1. Nick Johnson 
   2. Ryan Zurrer
1. Other bounties?
   1. Finding talented people is very hard. They are in such high demand. Trying to get people out of school. Online courses in Solidity.
      1. Web developers, software engineers.
      2. Separate recruiting approaches for the Foundation.
1. What are your biggest frustrations?
   1. Securing Electron (desktop JS) was hard. (JS in website can take over your system - happens with chrome)
   2. Integrating with other technologies: IPFS, Swarm, etc. Frustrating that they are all in their early days.
   3. Information overlap - this is a major problem - e.g. in keeping up-to-date with Solidity developments, even though I’m on the Foundation.
      1. A lot of people have been trying to integrate this information without success 
      2. I like two things from the Foundation:
         1. Daily standup for Geth team.
         2. Every quarter Vitalik and Ming post an update on what happened in the Foundation.
      1. To be improved at the Foundation:
         1. On the operational side:
            1. Make the foundation more open, more modular with their finances. Each team should have more autonomy, with their finances transparent on the blockchain.
         1. On the technical side:
            1. Autonomy would play into this as well.
      1. What are you excited about:
         1. Casper.
         2. Sharding.
         3. Applications: Aragon, MakerDAO.
