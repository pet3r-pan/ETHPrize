1. Who are you and what are you working on?
   1. Software developer at Consensys
   2. Known for Token Curated Registries 1.0. Works on team turning TCR’s into product which in turn informs the engineering/design. We fully intend the projects to succeed so we can incorporate feedback. It’s all still experimental, though.
   3. TCR came from AdChain. Deployed to Ethereum mainnet on April 24th. Useful for data on how people interact when there’s actual money at stake. New type of TCR where token supply inflates after every vote. 
   4. Adchain allows publishers and suppliers to find each other on a p2p. 
   5. By using TCRs to curate who may participate, cut out middlemen as well as bad actors. 
   6. Focus is on onboarding. 
1. What are the tools/libraries/frameworks you use?
   1. Truffle, useful as a testing framework.
   2. Solidity linter, Sol Lint. Not super good, but alright. Eventually, I want an Airbnb javascript plugin for ES Lint.
   3. Ganache Test-RPC
   4. Eth.js sometimes
1. What are your biggest frustrations?
   1. Truffle’s debugger is a bit disappointing. Works well for simple pattern, doesn’t support different types of contracts i.e. proxy pattern. 
   2. Need an Ethereum Package manager. Wishes packages were update. Should move from Ropsten to mainnet. Publishes and consumes to EthPM. Adoption is still low- EthPM. 
   3. Made technical assumptions early on, problem could only be discovered when going into production. User data you get from running on a testnet. People’s behavior changes as you add real money. 
      1. Offline simulations of incentive games with $10,000, offline IRL version. 
1. How do you handle testing?
   1. Writes tests in Javascript
   2. Sol Coverage tool
   3. Wants 100% code, branch etc.
   4. Github is part of testing workflow because of code reviews
   5. How do you handle smart contract verification and security?
   6. Also Josh Cassidy
1. What tools don’t exist at the moment?
   1. Fuzz Testing and formal verification desired.
1. What are the best educational resources?
   1. Solidity Docs
   2. Uses yellow paper gass lookup table
   3. Not sure
1. What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum?
   1. Hardest part is learning to develop in a blockchain environment, not solidity. Learning the javascript versus learning the browser. You can learn the language formally but learning how to apply the language in the browser. Blockchain environment is very different from anything else. 
1. Was anything easier than expected?
   1. What’s really easy is programming money. 
   2. On blockchain, every individual has universal payments identifier. 
1. Other bounties? 
   1. Pretty cool to have more languages for the EVM. Solidity is only reliable one. Yoichi’s Bamboo is moving along. 
1. What are you most excited about in the short term?
   1. Excited for Casper
   2. Applications implemented in Plasma, generalized state channels.
1. Who are the other people you think we should talk to?
   1. Infura team, client development
   2. Spankchain - pretty aggressive on focus to
