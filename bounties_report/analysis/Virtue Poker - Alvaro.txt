1. Who are you and what are you working on?
   1. VirtuePoker – offchain game, smart contracts to represent state of a poker game – offchain consensus of consensus, and submit to onchain. 
         1. Building poker with Ether, that can be played without an intermediary.
         2. When you leave the table, you cash out with the stake which you have left
1. What are your biggest frustrations?
   1. Whisper
      1. Building a p2p game. We tried using Whisper for real-time communication – does not have receipts; we have discarded it right now.
      2. Read a Stackoverflow about Status’ problems building on top of Whisper.
      3. The P2P is tough – need to be direct peers –– need to run neighbor nodes yourself.
         1. Connecting the mesh is tough.
         2. SO post said that Whisper doesn’t acknowledge receipt of messages.
      1. Running whisper on a geth node is optional.
      2. PROBLEM: whisper has low adoption.
      3. As a result, the game cannot be decentralized. All messages that are passed to each other between clients, are going through a centralized center.
      4. People use WebRTC with direct connections. But won’t work for them because they don’t want to reveal people’s IP addresses.
      5. There’s also a protocol called Telehash.
      6. DHT.
   1. Web3
      1. Switching to new release soon – interface change is coming.
      2. Callbacks are annoying; should use promises.
      3. We promisify the functions themselves.
      4. We’ve only used web3.
         1. A web3 alternative, ether.js (from L4) 
   1. Solidity
      1. Why doesn’t it have common data structures? e.g. a simple array; if you delete one item, you get a hole in the array.
         1. Need a way to store data that is indexed and where it can be safely deleted. Manually doing this stuff is bad..
            1. There are many implementations of this; but having a standard implementation would be really helpful.
         1. A lot of these things should be built into the language.
      1. SafeMath. I don’t use a lot of libraries otherwise.
      2. EthPM? -> It worked, kinda?
         1. Creating more low level libraries[a]?
      1. I like Remix. It has improved a lot.
         1. I had no problem with the UI.
         2. Like testing in Remix – though the debugger could be improved.
      1. Truffle is good, as well.
