1. Who are you and what are you working on?
   1. Lead blockchain dev @ HelloGold.
   2. Token backed by gold.
   3. Does consulting as well – writing smart contracts & backend for blockchain projects
1. What are your biggest frustrations?
   1. About a year ago, it was ok running blockchain on your machine.
   2. Switched from geth ropsten to Parity.
   3. It’s hard to run a Parity node now – the toll it takes on your machine.
      1. Both on mainnet and testnet.
   1. You can’t do serious stuff with Infura:
      1. e.g. getting events reliably
      2. In Geth or Parity you can do some event filtering, but is tough to get right and maintain
         1. Infura limits the number of logging or block calls -> to limit server complexity or costs.
   1. Debugger
      1. Ethercamp
         1. Promote hackathons.
         2. Ethereum Studio - what happened to it?
            1. Gave you break points in Solidity code (?!)
               1. You’re running in a simulated VM. You’re in your own dev environment.
            1. Let you see all the state and local variables & methods
         1. Came up with a node that EF took over and turned into EthereumJ
         2. Ethercamp code is open-source -> Look into this…
      1. I use Remix for prototyping something.
      2. Will probably be a niche product.. Because not many developers are getting that low level.
   1. Web3.js is another pain point:
      1. Getting up to speed trying to do Web3.js is quite hard. There’s a lot of conflicting information. The examples don’t work. This is where you find that the node you’re using doesn’t support features.
      2. Go-ethereum wrapper: abigen. This is my favorite tool.
1. How do you handle smart contract verification and security?
   1. Helps that I’ve been coding for a helluva long time.
   2. The hardest thing for new devs is getting to contact the people they need.
      1. It’s also hard to find non-expensive auditors.
   1. Gitter community is the key
   2. Best dev communities or Gitter channels:
      1. Go-ethereum
      2. Solidity
      3. Parity
   1. I go to the specific one I need at the time.
1. Other domain specific questions?
   1. Programming languages: Go
      1. Compiled program with strong type checking, before the code even runs.
      2. Enforces code standards, meaning your code is maintainable.
         1. The linter formats the code in a certain way. This makes it very easy to understand.
      1. I choose readability over speed; Go over Rust.
1. Who are the other people you think we should talk to?
   1. Talk to Andreas to get to people in Singapore.
   2. Rick Bale @ The team at Endorse.io
      1. Or also talk to the CTO.
